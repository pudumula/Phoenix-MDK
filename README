Phoenix-MDK Code
================
This project contains the softwares needed for using Phoenix-MDK. Find more about Phoenix-MDK from - http://www.iuac.res.in/~elab/phoenix/PMDK/index.html


Contents:
1) Bootloader for Phoenix-MDK
2) Python script for loading hex file using AVRDUDE.


Ingredients:
For compiling the bootloader and also for using Phoenix-MDK following are needed

1) gcc-avr -> Cross-Compiler
2) avr-libc -> AVR libraries
3) avrdude -> Tool for flashing the AVR microcontrollers
4) AVR programmer -> Hardware for transfering 
5) python -> Flashing code using bootloader and for making life easy 
6) Phoenix-MDK -> Phoenix Microcontroller Development Kit


Usage:
Phoenix-MDK contains an ATMega32 microcontroller with a 8-MHz crystal. It conatains a bootloader for loading the hex file into its flash memory through USB. If you need to compile the bootloader code for another clock frequency, don't forget to modify the makefile. 

Below command makes the bootloader hex file for ATMega32 microcontrollers with 8MHz crystal.
make atmega32
